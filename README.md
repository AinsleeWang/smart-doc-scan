# Smart Document Scanner

A smart document scanning and rectification system implemented with OpenCV. This project automatically detects document boundaries, corrects perspective distortion, and enhances image quality for optimal document digitization.

## Key Features
- Document Edge Detection: Automatically identifies document boundaries in images
- Perspective Correction: Transforms skewed documents into proper rectangular shape
- Image Enhancement: Improves readability and quality of scanned documents
- Shadow Removal: Reduces or eliminates shadows in document images
- Auto-cropping: Precisely crops the document area
